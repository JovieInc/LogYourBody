## What is NEAT?

NEAT stands for **Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis**the calories you burn from all activities that aren't formal exercise, sleeping, or eating.

Examples of NEAT:
- Walking and standing
- Fidgeting and gesturing
- Household chores
- Occupational activities
- Playing with kids or pets
- Taking the stairs

As Menno Henselmans emphasizes, NEAT is one of the most overlooked and most powerful tools for fat loss and body composition. It's the secret weapon hiding in plain sight.

## Why NEAT Matters More Than You Think

### The Energy Expenditure Breakdown

Your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) consists of:

1. **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate):** ~60-70% of TDEE
   - Energy to keep you alive (breathing, circulation, etc.)
   - Largely determined by muscle mass and genetics

2. **TEF (Thermic Effect of Food):** ~10% of TDEE
   - Energy to digest and process food
   - Protein has highest TEF (~25-30%)

3. **EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis):** ~5-10% of TDEE
   - Formal exercise (gym sessions)
   - **Smaller than most people think!**

4. **NEAT:** ~15-30% of TDEE
   - All non-exercise movement
   - **Highly variable between individuals**
   - **The lever you can control!**

### The NEAT Reality Check

Mike Israetel points out a shocking fact:

**A one-hour intense gym session might burn 300-500 calories.**

**But if you're sedentary the other 23 hours, you could be burning 800-1,200 FEWER calories than someone who walks 10,000+ steps daily.**

**The NEAT difference can exceed your entire gym session.**

## The Walking Advantage

### Walking vs. Cardio for Fat Loss

**Walking advantages:**
- Doesn't interfere with recovery from lifting
- Doesn't increase appetite significantly
- Doesn't cause muscle loss
- Sustainable indefinitely
- Can be done daily
- Low injury risk
- Can be done while doing other things (calls, podcasts, audiobooks)

**Traditional cardio drawbacks:**
- Increases fatigue and recovery demands
- Often increases appetite
- Can interfere with lifting performance
- Higher injury risk
- Hard to sustain long-term
- Requires dedicated time and energy

### The Research on Steps and Health

Studies consistently show that daily step count correlates with:
- Lower body fat percentage
- Better insulin sensitivity
- Improved cardiovascular health
- Reduced all-cause mortality
- Better mental health outcomes

**Dose-response relationship:**
- 5,000 steps: Sedentary (poor health outcomes)
- 7,500 steps: Moderate activity (health benefits start)
- 10,000 steps: Active (significant health benefits)
- 12,500+ steps: Very active (maximal benefits plateau)

## How Many Steps Should You Aim For?

### The Evidence-Based Targets

Menno Henselmans' recommendations based on goals:

**Maintenance/Health:**
- 7,500-10,000 steps per day
- Maintain body composition
- General health benefits

**Fat Loss (Moderate):**
- 10,000-12,500 steps per day
- Creates 200-300 calorie deficit
- Sustainable long-term

**Fat Loss (Aggressive):**
- 12,500-15,000 steps per day
- Creates 300-500 calorie deficit
- May need to reduce as you get leaner

**Muscle Gain (Bulking):**
- 6,000-8,000 steps per day
- Don't want to create deficit
- Focus energy on recovery and growth

### The 10,000 Step "Rule"

The 10,000 step guideline came from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign, but research has since validated it as a reasonable target for most people.

**Why 10,000 is solid:**
- Creates meaningful energy expenditure
- Achievable for most people
- Provides health benefits
- Doesn't impair recovery
- Easy to remember and track

## NEAT Adaptation: The Diet's Hidden Enemy

### The Metabolic Adaptation Problem

When you diet, your body doesn't just reduce BMRit also unconsciously reduces NEAT.

**Research shows:**
- In a 500-calorie deficit, BMR might drop 50-100 calories
- But NEAT can drop 200-500 calories!
- You fidget less
- You stand less
- You take fewer steps
- You move less throughout the day

**This is why "calories in vs. calories out" is harder than it seems.**

Mike Israetel calls this "the body's sneaky way of defending fat stores." Your brain downregulates unconscious movement to conserve energy.

### Fighting Back Against NEAT Adaptation

**The solution: Track and defend your step count.**

**During a cut:**
- Set a step target (10,000+)
- Monitor daily via smartphone or fitness tracker
- **Don't let steps drop as diet progresses**
- May need to intentionally add walks to compensate

**Example:**
- Week 1 of cut: Naturally hitting 10,000 steps
- Week 8 of cut: Only hitting 6,500 steps without trying
- **Solution:** Add 2 deliberate walks to hit 10,000 again

**This maintains your total energy expenditure and prevents metabolic slowdown.**

## Practical Strategies to Increase NEAT

### Easy Ways to Add Steps

**Morning routine:**
- 10-minute walk after waking
- Walk to get coffee
- Park farther away

**Work strategies:**
- Walking meetings
- Walk during phone calls
- Take stairs instead of elevator
- Walk to colleague's desk instead of email
- Walk during lunch break

**Evening routine:**
- Walk after dinner (bonus: improves glucose control)
- Walk the dog
- Walk while listening to podcasts/audiobooks

**Weekend activities:**
- Hiking
- Walking to errands
- Playing outdoor sports
- Museum or mall browsing

### Making It Sustainable

**The key: Make walking enjoyable, not a chore.**

**Pair walking with enjoyment:**
- Audiobooks or podcasts
- Music playlists
- Phone calls with friends/family
- Walking with partner, kids, or dog
- Explore new neighborhoods
- Walking meetings

**Use environmental design:**
- Put walking shoes by door
- Set phone reminders
- Schedule walks in calendar
- Find a walking buddy for accountability

## Walking for Muscle Retention During Cuts

### Why Walking Preserves Muscle

When you're in a caloric deficit, your body can break down muscle for energy. Walking helps prevent this through several mechanisms:

**1. Low-Stress Energy Expenditure**
- Doesn't compete with lifting for recovery
- Doesn't deplete glycogen stores
- Doesn't create additional cortisol stress

**2. Improved Nutrient Partitioning**
- Better insulin sensitivity
- Improved glucose disposal
- Enhanced fat oxidation

**3. Maintained Training Performance**
- More total calories available
- Can keep protein and carbs higher
- Better gym performance = muscle preservation

### Walking vs. Cardio for Cuts

Mike Israetel's hierarchy for creating a caloric deficit:

**Tier 1 (Do This First):**
1. Reduce food intake slightly
2. Increase daily steps to 10,000+

**Tier 2 (If Tier 1 Isn't Enough):**
3. Reduce food intake further
4. Add 1-2 low-intensity cardio sessions

**Tier 3 (Advanced/Aggressive Cuts):**
5. Reduce food further (not below ~1,200 for women, ~1,800 for men)
6. Add more cardio if absolutely necessary

**Why this order?**
- Walking has the best sustainability
- Preserves recovery capacity
- Least hunger-inducing
- Most muscle-protective

## NEAT for Muscle Gain

### Don't Over-Do Steps While Bulking

When the goal is maximum muscle growth, excessive NEAT can be counterproductive:

**Problems with too many steps during a bulk:**
- Burns calories needed for growth
- Uses recovery capacity
- May reduce strength in gym
- Requires eating even MORE food

**Menno Henselmans' recommendation:**
- 6,000-8,000 steps during muscle gain phases
- Enough for health and digestion
- Not so much that it creates unwanted deficit
- Save energy for lifting heavy and recovery

## Tracking Your Steps

### Tools for Tracking

**Smartphone (Free):**
- iPhone Health app
- Google Fit
- Most phones track steps automatically

**Fitness Trackers ($):**
- Apple Watch
- Fitbit
- Garmin
- Whoop
- Oura Ring

**Tips for accuracy:**
- Wear tracker consistently
- Calibrate stride length if possible
- Understand that all trackers have ~10% error
- Trends matter more than exact numbers

### How to Use Step Data

**Daily monitoring:**
- Check steps each evening
- If below target, take a walk before bed
- Use as accountability tool

**Weekly analysis:**
- Calculate weekly average
- Look for patterns (weekday vs. weekend)
- Identify opportunities to add steps

**Monthly trends:**
- Compare to previous month
- Watch for unconscious reductions during diet
- Adjust targets based on goals

**Integration with LogYourBody:**
- Track daily steps alongside body weight
- Monitor correlation with body composition changes

## The NEAT Lifestyle

### Building a High-NEAT Life

**The goal: Engineer your environment for natural movement.**

**Home setup:**
- No TV remote (get up to change channel)
- Pets to walk
- Garden to maintain
- Keep items on different floors

**Work setup:**
- Standing desk option
- Walking breaks every hour
- Active commute (walk, bike, park far)
- Opt for stairs

**Social life:**
- Active dates (walks, hiking, sports)
- Walk-and-talk with friends
- Active hobbies
- Dog ownership

**Mindset:**
- View walking as "you time," not exercise
- Make it enjoyable
- Don't stress about hitting target every single day
- Aim for weekly averages

## Common Mistakes and Myths

### Mistake 1: "I worked out, so I'm active"

**The problem:**
- 1 hour of exercise ` active lifestyle
- The other 23 hours matter MORE

**The fix:**
- Track total daily steps
- Realize gym time is small portion of day
- Increase NEAT outside the gym

### Mistake 2: "More is always better"

**The problem:**
- Excessive steps can impair recovery
- Diminishing returns above 15,000 steps
- Can create unwanted deficit when bulking

**The fix:**
- Match steps to your goal
- 10,000 for fat loss
- 6,000-8,000 for muscle gain
- More isn't always better

### Mistake 3: "I'll burn fat with intense cardio instead"

**The problem:**
- Intense cardio increases appetite
- Harder to recover from
- Less sustainable
- May lose muscle

**The fix:**
- Prioritize steps and walking
- Add intense cardio sparingly
- Walking is the foundation

### Myth: "Walking doesn't burn enough calories to matter"

**The reality:**
- 10,000 steps H 400-500 calories
- That's the equivalent of a large meal
- Over a week: 2,800-3,500 calories
- Over a month: ~1 pound of fat loss
- **With zero impact on recovery**

## Sample Step Strategies by Goal

### Fat Loss Example (180lb male)

**Target:** 10,000-12,500 steps daily

**Sample day:**
- 6:30 AM: 15-min morning walk (2,000 steps)
- 12:00 PM: Walk during lunch (3,000 steps)
- 3:00 PM: Walk around office (1,000 steps)
- 6:00 PM: Walk after dinner (3,000 steps)
- Miscellaneous daily movement (2,000 steps)
- **Total: 11,000 steps**

**Diet:**
- Calories: 2,200 (500 deficit)
- Protein: 180g
- Resistance training: 4x per week

### Muscle Gain Example (180lb male)

## The Bottom Line

NEAT, and particularly walking, is one of the most powerful and underutilized tools for body composition.

**Key takeaways:**
1. **10,000 steps creates a meaningful energy deficit** without impacting recovery
2. **NEAT often exceeds gym calorie burn** over the course of a day
3. **Walking preserves muscle during cuts** better than traditional cardio
4. **Your body reduces NEAT unconsciously during diets**you must defend it
5. **Match your step target to your goal** (more for fat loss, less for muscle gain)

Use LogYourBody to track your daily steps alongside your body metrics. You'll likely find that step count correlates strongly with your body composition progress.

As both Menno Henselmans and Mike Israetel emphasize: **the unsexy, simple stufflike walkingoften matters more than the complex stuff.**

Get your steps in. Your body composition (and health) will thank you.
