## What is Body Recomposition?

Body recomposition (recomp) is the process of simultaneously losing body fat while building muscle mass. While traditional fitness advice suggests you must either bulk or cut, the research shows that recomp is possiblebut with important caveats.

As Menno Henselmans' research demonstrates, body recomposition is not equally effective for everyone. Your ability to recomp depends heavily on your training status, body composition, and approach.

## Who Can Successfully Recomp?

### Best Candidates for Recomp

**1. Complete Beginners**
- Untrained individuals have the highest potential for recomp
- "Newbie gains" allow muscle growth even in a deficit
- Can expect 0.5-1lb muscle gain per month while losing fat

**2. Detrained Individuals**
- Those returning after a long layoff
- Muscle memory effect accelerates regrowth
- Can recomp for 3-6 months upon return

**3. Enhanced Athletes**
- Performance-enhancing drugs dramatically increase recomp potential
- Not relevant for natural lifters
- Outside the scope of this article

**4. Overweight Beginners**
- Higher body fat provides energy for muscle growth
- Best recomp potential when combining training and fat loss
- Can achieve dramatic transformations

### Poor Candidates for Recomp

**1. Advanced Natural Lifters**
- Close to genetic potential
- Must choose: bulk or cut
- Recomp becomes painfully slow

**2. Already Lean Individuals (<12% body fat for men, <22% for women)**
- Insufficient energy reserves for muscle growth in a deficit
- Better to slow bulk or maintain

## The Science: Why Recomp Works (Sometimes)

Mike Israetel explains the energy systems at play:

### Energy Balance Paradox

You can be in a:
- **Systemic caloric deficit** (whole body)
- While having a **local caloric surplus** (muscle tissue)

How? Your body uses stored fat as fuel while directing dietary protein and nutrients toward muscle growth.

### Requirements for This to Work

1. **Sufficient body fat stores** (>15% for men, >25% for women)
2. **Adequate protein intake** (1-1.2g per lb bodyweight)
3. **Progressive resistance training** (strong growth stimulus)
4. **Modest caloric deficit** (200-500 calories below maintenance)

## Optimal Recomp Strategy

### Training Protocol

Based on Renaissance Periodization's hypertrophy guidelines:

**Volume:**
- 12-20 sets per muscle group per week
- Train each muscle 2-3x per week
- Focus on compound movements

**Intensity:**
- Train close to failure (1-3 reps in reserve)
- Use a variety of rep ranges: 5-30 reps
- Emphasis on the 8-15 rep range for most work

**Progressive Overload:**
- Add weight or reps each week
- Track your lifts meticulously
- This is your muscle-building stimulus

**Sample Split:**
- Push/Pull/Legs 2x per week
- Upper/Lower 4x per week
- Full body 3-4x per week

### Nutrition Protocol

**Protein:**
- **1-1.2g per lb of bodyweight** (higher than typical bulk)
- Distributed across 4-5 meals
- Minimum 30g per meal with 3g leucine

**Caloric Deficit:**
- **250-500 calorie deficit** (0.5-1lb loss per week)
- Too aggressive = muscle loss
- Too modest = minimal fat loss

**Carbohydrates:**
- Time around training (before/after workouts)
- 1-2g per lb bodyweight for most
- Provides training fuel and aids recovery

**Fats:**
- 0.3-0.5g per lb bodyweight minimum
- Essential for hormone production
- Fill remaining calories after protein and carbs

### Sample Day (180lb individual recomping)

**Maintenance Calories:** 2,700
**Recomp Target:** 2,400 (-300)

**Macros:**
- Protein: 200g (800 cal)
- Carbs: 250g (1,000 cal)
- Fat: 67g (600 cal)
- **Total: 2,400 calories**

**Meal Distribution:**

**Meal 1 (7 AM):**
- 3 whole eggs + 3 egg whites
- 1 cup oatmeal
- 1 banana
- *Protein: 40g | Carbs: 65g | Fat: 18g*

**Meal 2 (11 AM - Pre-Workout):**
- 6oz chicken breast
- 1 cup white rice
- Vegetables
- *Protein: 50g | Carbs: 55g | Fat: 5g*

**Meal 3 (2 PM - Post-Workout):**
- 8oz lean ground beef
- 1 large sweet potato
- Vegetables
- *Protein: 50g | Carbs: 60g | Fat: 15g*

**Meal 4 (6 PM):**
- 6oz salmon
- 1 cup quinoa
- Mixed vegetables with olive oil
- *Protein: 40g | Carbs: 50g | Fat: 20g*

**Meal 5 (9 PM):**
- Greek yogurt with berries
- *Protein: 20g | Carbs: 20g | Fat: 9g*

## Realistic Expectations

### Timeline for Recomp

Menno Henselmans' data suggests:

**Months 1-3 (Beginners):**
- Fat loss: 1-2 lbs per month
- Muscle gain: 1-2 lbs per month
- Net scale weight: Minimal change
- Visual changes: Significant

**Months 4-6:**
- Fat loss: 1-2 lbs per month
- Muscle gain: 0.5-1 lb per month
- Progress slows but continues

**Months 7-12:**
- Recomp becomes very slow
- Consider switching to bulk/cut cycles
- Advanced trainees should abandon recomp

### Measuring Progress

**Don't rely on the scale alone!** During recomp, bodyweight may barely change while composition improves dramatically.

**Better Metrics:**
1. **Progress photos** (weekly, same lighting/time)
2. **Body measurements** (chest, waist, arms, thighs)
3. **Performance in the gym** (strength should maintain or increase)
4. **Waist measurement** (should decrease)
5. **How clothes fit**

Use LogYourBody to track all these metrics consistently.

## Common Recomp Mistakes

### 1. Too Aggressive on Calories

**The Problem:** Cutting calories too low (>750 deficit)
- Kills muscle-building potential
- Becomes a regular cut with minimal muscle growth
- Better to just cut faster at that point

**The Fix:** Stay in 250-500 calorie deficit range

### 2. Inadequate Protein

**The Problem:** Eating "bulk protein" (0.7-0.8g/lb)
- Not enough for muscle growth in a deficit
- Increases risk of muscle loss

**The Fix:** Bump to 1-1.2g per lb bodyweight

### 3. Junk Volume Training

Mike Israetel's principle: **"Stimulative reps build muscle, junk volume just creates fatigue."**

**The Problem:**
- Long workouts with lots of easy sets
- Not training close to failure
- Poor exercise selection

**The Fix:**
- 45-75 minute focused sessions
- Train 1-3 reps from failure on working sets
- Prioritize compound movements

### 4. Impatience

**The Problem:** Expecting dramatic weekly changes

Recomp is SLOW. You might lose 1-2 lbs of fat and gain 0.5-1 lb muscle in a month. Scale barely moves. People give up.

**The Fix:**
- Commit to 3-6 month blocks
- Focus on non-scale metrics
- Take monthly progress photos
- Trust the process

### 5. Trying to Recomp When You Shouldn't

**The Problem:** Advanced lifters spinning their wheels

If you're already lean (<12% men, <22% women) and have 2+ years of serious training, recomp is inefficient.

**The Fix:**
- Run proper bulk/cut cycles
- Bulk: +200-300 calories, gain 0.5-1 lb per month
- Cut: -500 calories, lose 1-2 lbs per month
- More efficient than endless recomp

## Recomp vs. Bulk/Cut Cycles

### When to Recomp
- You're a beginner (training age <1 year)
- You're overweight (>20% body fat men, >30% women)
- You're returning from a long layoff
- You can't psychologically handle bulk/cut cycles
- You have 3-6 months of patience

### When to Bulk/Cut Instead
- Advanced trainee (2+ years serious training)
- Already lean
- Want faster results in either direction
- Understand and accept bulk/cut methodology

## The Recomp Verdict

Both Menno Henselmans and Mike Israetel agree:

**Body recomposition works, but it's not optimal for everyone.**

- **Beginners:** Recomp is fantastic. You'll transform your physique.
- **Intermediates:** Can work for 3-6 months, then progress slows.
- **Advanced:** Very inefficient. Bulk or cut.

The key is matching your strategy to your training status and goals.

## Getting Started with Recomp

1. **Calculate your maintenance calories**
   - Track intake for 2 weeks at current weight
   - Use TDEE calculators as starting point
   - Adjust based on results

2. **Set your target**
   - 250-500 below maintenance
   - 1-1.2g protein per lb bodyweight
   - Carbs and fats to fill remaining calories

3. **Start a proven training program**
   - 3-5 days per week
   - Progressive overload
   - 12-20 sets per muscle per week

4. **Track everything**
   - Daily weigh-ins (weekly average)
   - Progress photos every 2 weeks
   - Body measurements monthly
   - Gym performance weekly

5. **Be patient**
   - Commit to 12 weeks minimum
   - Adjust calories only if weight average trends wrong direction for 2+ weeks
   - Focus on strength progression

Use LogYourBody to track your metrics, photos, and measurements throughout your recomp journey. The data will tell the story that the scale might miss.

## Final Thoughts

Body recomposition is real, science-backed, and achievableif you're the right candidate using the right approach. It requires patience, precision, and progressive training.

For beginners and detrained individuals, it's often the best approach. For advanced natural lifters, bulk/cut cycles are more efficient.

Know where you are in your training journey, set realistic expectations, and trust the process.

The body you want is built one quality training session and well-tracked meal at a time.
