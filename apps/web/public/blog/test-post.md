## What is Body Recomposition?

Body recomposition refers to the process of simultaneously building muscle while losing fat. This is a game-changer for fitness because it means you don't have to choose between getting stronger and getting leaner.

### Key Principles

1. **Protein Intake**: Aim for 0.8-1g per pound of body weight
2. **Progressive Overload**: Constantly challenge your muscles
3. **Caloric Balance**: Slight deficit or maintenance calories
4. **Consistency**: Stay committed for 8-12 weeks minimum

## Why This Matters

The fitness industry has sold us a lie: you have to choose between bulking and cutting. Body recomposition proves this is false. When done properly, you can improve body composition while maintaining or even gaining weight.
